Terminal match-3 game inspired by Bejeweled.

To run the game. run `main.py` with Python. You need the curses module.

To navigate in SELECT mode, use the arrow keys. Hit space to enter SWAP mode where you can swap a piece with any adjacent
one using the arrow keys. Alternatively you can use Vim keybinds by default.

If you notice everything's too small, try changing your terminal's font size (the game doesn't work with graphics, rather with text, so this is the only way things can be enlarged.)

# Running

cmdjewel is a Python project. To run it, extract the source code to a folder, ensure you have Python installed, and inside the directory, run python . in a terminal. You can optionally install PyGame to play soundtrack.
